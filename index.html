        <section>
            <h2>🚀 Overview</h2>
            <div>
                <p>KhetiAI started from a simple observation: farmers in my area struggled with crop diseases but had no quick way to identify or treat them. Having helped farmers at my family's agriculture shop, I saw this problem firsthand.</p>
                <p>So in June 2025, I started building KhetiAI - a mobile app that uses AI to detect crop diseases instantly. But it became more than that. Farmers also needed help managing budgets, finding equipment to rent, checking weather, and planning their tasks. So we built all of that into one platform.</p>
                <p>I led a team of 7 people from different countries to build this. The app uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash AI model, which analyzes crop photos and tells farmers exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. We also added a marketplace where farmers can rent tractors and equipment, a budget tracker, weather forecasts, and a task scheduler.</p>

            <h2>🧩 Technical Details </h2>
            
            <div>
                <h3>Gemini API Integration</h3>
                <p>I built a Cloudflare Worker to handle the AI requests. The tricky part was handling rate limits from Google's API. Here's how I implemented retry logic with exponential backoff:</p>
                <pre>let apiResponse;
for (let attempt = 0; attempt < MAX_RETRIES; attempt++) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(apiUrl, {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify(payload)
        });

        if (response.ok) {
            apiResponse = await response.json();
            break;
        }

        if (response.status === 429 || response.status >= 500) {
            if (attempt < MAX_RETRIES - 1) {
                const delay = getExponentialBackoffDelay(attempt);
                await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
                continue;
            }
        }
    } catch (networkError) {
        if (attempt < MAX_RETRIES - 1) {
            const delay = getExponentialBackoffDelay(attempt);
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
            continue;
        }
        throw networkError;
    }
}</pre>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Structured JSON Responses</h3>
                <p>The AI needs to return consistent data every time. I enforce this using a JSON schema that guarantees we always get plant type, disease name, severity, and treatment steps:</p>
                <pre>const responseSchema = {
    type: "OBJECT",
    properties: {
        "plant_type": {
            "type": "STRING",
            "description": "Type of plant (e.g., 'Tomato', 'Rose')"
        },
        "disease_name": {
            "type": "STRING",
            "description": "Disease name or 'Healthy'"
        },
        "severity": {
            "type": "STRING",
            "description": "'Low', 'Medium', or 'High'"
        },
        "treatment_steps": {
            "type": "ARRAY",
            "items": { "type": "STRING" }
        }
    },
    required: ["plant_type", "disease_name", "severity", "treatment_steps"]
};</pre>
            </div>

            <h2>💡 What I Learned</h2>
            <ul class="learnings">
                <li>Managing a remote team across time zones is harder than I thought. Clear communication and realistic deadlines became essential</li>
                <li>Working with developers from different countries taught me how to adapt to different work styles and cultures</li>
                <li>I learned Flutter by working closely with our mobile developers and asking tons of questions</li>
                <li>Hardest part: convincing good developers to work for revenue share instead of upfront payment. Had to really sell the vision</li>
                <li>Most of us were students juggling classes and development. Time management became critical</li>
                <li>Biggest lesson: just start building. Don't wait for everything to be perfect. Things work out when you put in the time</li>
                <li>You have to believe in your idea and protect it, but also stay open to feedback</li>
            </ul>
